## The Pyramid of Motivation

1. Look for a *mission* the needs to be done, that you could do. In order to sustain motivation over several years, you need a long term vision or end state that you are working towards. (e.g. Save the world)
2. To achieve the mission, you need to break it down into a heirarchy of measurable *goals*. Nothing motivates like successfully hitting a goal. (e.g. Get hired by MegaCorp)
3. To achieve goals, each individual needs a few things:
- Need to know the thread of how working towards this goal is in their own interest.
- Be given as much responsibility as they can handle to come up with their own plan. They will feel the task is worth doing if this is the case.
4. Practice continious improvement over time by turning attention inward towards processes. Exponentially componunding efficiency improvements accure over time if you can become 1% more effective each day.

## Continious Improvement
1. Pay attention to your own processes.
2. Identify a problem.
3. Discuss this with people you trust. This requires:
- Good Atmsophere.
- Assume others have info that you can learn.
- Dialectic, being able to disagree so you can iterate an idea so it aligns to be effective in as many situtations as possible.
4. Test this idea, along with other ones as well. Often this takes the form of an AB test, looking to see if the change has a positive impact. Continue to iterate or abandon ideas that do not work.
5. Once you have a change that is effective, embed it in your process. This means creating an implicit expectation that your change is 'the way things are done'. For example, when creating apps our process is to do rapid prototyping, iterating on ideas and testing with kids the same day, in a tight loop.
